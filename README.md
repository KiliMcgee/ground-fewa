# ground-fewa

This repository contains efforts related to a Front End Web App Development course
taken during my graduate studies at The Johns Hopkins University.

Github Pages are being used to serve the site
<a href="https://kilimcgee.github.io/ground-fewa/">here</a>, which explains the 
need for a `/docs` directory as the root for the project.

That's it; enjoy!
